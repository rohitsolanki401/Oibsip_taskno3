Users can log in with a predefined User ID and PIN to access functionalities such as withdrawals, deposits, transfers, and viewing transaction history. The application features a user-friendly console interface, ensuring a smooth interaction experience. Designed with an object-oriented approach, it encapsulates user data and banking operations in separate classes.
